Welcome,

In order to run the program you will have to first check that you have all the packages.
These are imported in the program - Finale.py.

Afterwards, Chrome Driver.
Check your Chrome version:
In Chrome -> click on the 3 dots -> 'Help' -> 'About Google Chrome' -> There you will see the current version.
The current chromedriver in this directory is of Version 98 for mac64.
Other versions are available here:
    "https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/"

replace the chromedriver in this directory with the new EXTRACTED one.
Make sure that it has the same name! (etc, not 1 or 2 added at the end)

You are now ready to run the program!

It's pretty much self explanatory but here is a quick overview:

We have two options for the server,
    Default - uses the GET method calls in order to pass the name&password of the user in the url address.
              In this option, one can chose to grab to name & password without checking for the ID,
              in order to later use selenium to try and fetch it.
              Another option will be to change the method (option 4 in the main menu) so that the server
              will automatically try to fetch the ID of the user.
              In the latter option, one's details will be added to the json file ONLY if the name & password
              were valid and an ID was successfully fetched (ID will obviously be added to the json)

    POST - uses the POST method calls. this one is much safer and easier to be applied. As far for you, the program-user,
           the program will behave just the same as the second option of the GET methods.

    In order to switch server / turn them off the program must be shut down. Don't worry, the json file wont be harmed.
